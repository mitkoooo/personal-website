## How It's Made

**Tech used:** React, TailwindCSS, MDX, TypeScript, Next-js

Home page uses Project Ladder component that makes use of Compound Component Pattern. Each other project page and 'About' page are written using MDX to reflect the 'Blog' style of my portfolio.

Overwhelming majority of pages in this project are static, allowing for faster initial loading speeds.

Darkmode on this website is done without using any dependencies, relieving the dependency load on the initial JavaScript bundle that is being downloaded by the user
