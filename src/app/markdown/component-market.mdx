Component-market is the first web application I have created.
Component-market demonstrates my standalone React components that can be reused
by other developers. It was my first experience in planning, writing and solving
problems regarding web development.\
\
Working on this project taught me vaulable experience about how to use url parameters, how to create overlays and how to implement search functionionality.\
\
Unfortunately, I do not maintain this website anymore, but if you are curious to check it out, click on this [<ins>_link_</ins>](https://component-market.vercel.app).
