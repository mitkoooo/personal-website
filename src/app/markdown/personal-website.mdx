<h1 className="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">Personal website</h1>

My second major project was my personal website, the one you are at right now. The main idea was to introduce myself and then make it accessible to view all my projects that I have created over the time.\
\
So far it is my favorite project I have done, because I got to do extensive planning on how should the website look on different screens and I was able to solve problems and implement some features on my own without using additional dependencies! For example, I have done dark mode on this website without using a single dependency for that.\
\
I have to mention that I got the idea for some of my website's design from the blog of the CEO of Vercel. I was fascinated how simple, yet aesthetic was his website's design and wanted to have my personal website to look similar.\
